IPE Test Suite

Quick Start

  ipets [suite]               : run standard or named suite
  ipets baseline [suite]      : run standard or named suite & store a baseline
  ipets clean                 : remove most objects created by the test suite
  ipets cleaner               : ipets clean + removes 'baseline' & data archive
  ipets help                  : shows this usage information
  ipets run <name>            : perform the single named run
  ipets show run|suite <name> : show configuration of the named run or suite

Baseline Creation / Comparison

  To create a baseline, run 'ipets baseline [suite]'. If [suite] is unspecified,
  the 'standard' suite will be used. A directory named 'baseline' (which must
  not already exist) will be created in the current directory, and the output of
  the test-suite runs stored there.

  The test suite will automatically compare its runs' output to the contents of
  the 'baseline' directory if one exists. You may copy or link a previously
  generated baseline directory here, or make a new one with the 'baseline'
  command (see above).

A useful workflow might consist of these steps:

  1. Check out a fresh IPE working copy from Subversion.
  2. Run 'ipets baseline [suite]' to generate a baseline.
  3. Make changes to the working copy as needed.
  4. Run 'ipets [suite]' to verify your changes against the baseline.

Logging

  Each 'ipets' invocation that does not fail immediately generates a verbose
  logfile named 'log.timestamp', where timestamp is the seconds-since-epoch
  test-suite start time.
